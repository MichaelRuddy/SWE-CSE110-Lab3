##StandUp Meeting Notes
# What I've Done
So far I have watched the intro video, read through the lab write up to prepare for what I have to do, and I created issues within github which I will have to resolve to complete this assignment.  I have completed part 1 at this point and am now going to begin part 2.
#What I need to do
Part 2 of the assignment.  I need to be patient since I have not used CSS before and I want to make sure I understand everything pretty well before I start my coding, so that I will have an easier time debugging.
